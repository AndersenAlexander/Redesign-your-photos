## ‚ú® Core Features
This application is packed with professional-grade features designed to provide maximum creative control and efficiency.

## ü§ñ Advanced AI Editing Tools
Prompt-Based Retouching: The core functionality. Simply describe the changes you want, and the AI will generate multiple variations.
Magic Edit (Inpainting): Select a specific area of your image with an interactive brush and apply your prompt only to that region for precise modifications.
Magic Eraser (Object Removal): Draw over any unwanted object, and the AI will intelligently remove it and reconstruct the background seamlessly.
Generative Fill (Outpainting): Expand your image beyond its original borders. Use the resizable frame to define new areas, and the AI will generate new content that naturally extends the scene.
Style Transfer: Apply the complete aesthetic (colors, textures, style) of one image to another. Use a famous painting or any reference image to creatively transform your photos.
One-Click Upscaling: Enhance the resolution and detail of any generated image with a single click.
Batch Processing: Upload multiple images and apply the same prompt or enhancement to all of them in a single run, complete with a progress indicator.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow & Generation Controls
Negative Prompts: Specify what you don't want in the output for more refined results.
Favorite Prompts: Save, manage, and instantly apply your most-used prompt combinations to speed up your workflow.
Advanced Settings: A collapsible section for power users, featuring:
Temperature Slider: Control the AI's creativity, from predictable to highly experimental.
Seed Input: Use a specific seed for reproducible results, perfect for iterative tweaking.
Aspect Ratio Control: Choose from common aspect ratios (Square, Portrait, Landscape, Widescreen) for your final images.


## üé® User Interface & Experience
Interactive Before/After Slider: Directly compare the original and retouched images with a draggable slider.
Persistent History: Every editing session is automatically saved to your browser's local storage. You can browse and restore any previous state, including all images and settings.
Light & Dark Modes: A sleek theme toggle that respects your OS preference and saves your choice.
Client-Side Filters: Apply quick post-processing filters like Grayscale, Sepia, Blur, and Sharpen to the final results.
Modern Animations & Transitions: A fluid and polished interface with subtle animations for a premium user experience.
Non-Blocking Notifications: A "toast" notification system provides elegant, non-intrusive feedback for all actions.
Fully Responsive: The layout adapts beautifully to any screen size, from mobile devices to desktops.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, TypeScript
AI Engine: Google Gemini API (@google/genai) for all image generation and manipulation tasks.
